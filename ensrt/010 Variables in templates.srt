00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,330
So now we're going to learn how to assign a value to a variable in a template and that looks like this.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,090
All right so here's my template and here is the value which I've passed into my template I'm taking

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,150
that value and using the short declaration.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,230
Operator I'm assigning it to a variable in my template and so those of you who are coming from PH are

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,580
going to feel happy that you use dollar signs to access our variables again.

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:29,950
Right.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,920
But I assign that value to a variable and now I can access that variable anywhere on my template and

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,410
display its value right.

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,370
So that comes in handy sometimes.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,390
It's good to know about I just wanted to point it out and show you this is how you do it.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,820
And this is the exact same file that we saw in the previous video in the previous example except I've

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,010
changed the data that's being passed down.

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:04,220
I'm passing in a string here instead of an int and and I Severgnini is parse Glubb throughout the course.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,720
And you notice I'm using parse files.

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,740
But hopefully after looking at that two videos back about parsing and executing templates parsing and

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,220
executing files hopefully you see from the standard library how that all works because template parse

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,260
files or template parse glob both give me back a value a pointer to a template a value of type pointer

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,340
to a template and an heir by using must.

19
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,510
So I don't have to check that Arutz checking it for me that I get my TBO and execute template and I

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,130
specify the template I'm executing.

21
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,970
So I'm just using parse files because we're only parsing one file and I don't have a folder.

22
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,710
So anyhow that's when I'm passing And so when I run this because the proof is in the pudding.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:58,890
You talk about cooking all day long but unless you cook something that I cannot talk and type apparently

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,240
at the same time.

25
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,270
Yeah right.

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,620
So I'll talk unless you're actually cooking stuff that tastes good.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,550
Cool.

28
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,180
There you go.

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:16,740
So I passed on the meaning of life release self-focus embrace other focus.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,400
So that's it.

31
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,870
I passed in the data.

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,500
Right.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,410
And I took that value and I signed it to a variable and I printed that variable out.
