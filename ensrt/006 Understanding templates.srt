1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,440
The first thing we're going to learn about our templates and templates are really important to web programming.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,680
Templates allow us to personalize web pages for the user.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:17,760
And we're going to devote the first folders here of code 0 2 3 0 12 to understanding how templates work

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,530
with Go programming.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,770
And there are some nuances to the standard library where you know for a lot of individuals if they try

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,600
to learn template straight from the standard library it's a struggle for them and it's hard for them

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,430
to figure out.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,300
But I'm going to show you and have code resources to show you how to use templates using go.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,300
I'm going to explain to you all of the nuances and so we'll see how to use functions pass functions

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,230
into templates how to pass data into templates how to access the data how a range or loop over data

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,030
inside of our templates.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,020
And yes that's what we're going to see in a lot of hands on examples for you to practice like using

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,570
templates and passing data into templates and accessing that data and then templates will also see how

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,930
to abstract and modularize our code so we get you know take a page and break it into different parts

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,740
and then bring it back together.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,350
And so I'm going to show you how to use nested templates.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,500
And that's something else you're going to see as we work through templates.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,020
Just a general understanding and definition of what templates are in case there's people out there and

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,100
this is like Hey I'm just getting started with webdav and it's your first time through and you've taken

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,740
the Go programming course and you're like OK how do I do webdav.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,840
So template is like a form letter.

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,100
And in the in the sense that you have a generic letter like down here I have a generic letter right.

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,280
And this generic letter is going to be customized or personalized for every user in a database.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,490
And so when I run a little program it will take for each user put their name there and then print the

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,200
ladder.

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,670
And so what comes out is something like this.

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,160
And when we use templates and web programming that's how we get personalized pages we create one page

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,520
and we say hey in this area put the user's profile in this area bring down the user's account information

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,130
and show the account information for that one user.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,930
And so we're pulling that data out of a database and showing it on the template.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,770
In standard library we have two packages we have text template and we also have each team template and

32
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,660
so text template lays the foundation for templates HVM template is everything which text template is.

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,270
And some additional functionality for doing each female pages.

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,240
Right so it has a lot of safety for preventing.

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,900
You know web attacks and cross-site scripting and things like that so it escapes a lot of characters

36
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,510
I've put together read me files at the beginning.

37
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,680
Right so if you look at our code base and we look through folders 0 2 3 0 12 there's a read we filed

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,210
the beginning of each of those folders like here is understanding templates and then techniques will

39
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:06,840
learn and code will use from the standard library write and type template and parsing templates.

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,500
And so for each folder there's little read me kind of showing you the highlights of what you should

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,760
get out of this section so you can look through each of these read.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,360
And he kind of picked out like these are the things I need to know.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,980
Or are you going to follow me through all of the videos and step through each one and explain them.
